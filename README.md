Some info about me;

Hihihih! I go by Archer. I have no idea how to introduce myself, but I'll try my best. I'm an introvert; I don't talk much, and my English is very horrible, so my words often come off. I'm kinda awkward and have social anxiety, so it would take me a while to interact with people. 🫠 Please be patient with me. I'm an artist. I sometimes post my artworks on social media. I love Green Lanterns and alien robots. My friends are very cool. Birthday is on the 23rd November ^_*

Before you INT; 

1. No DNI needed..? ; I don't know if doubles count, but I won't INT unless you're a friend of ours, sorry 😞. We don't mind if any of our friends have the same kins as us 👍.

 
 2.   I need more Booster Gold fans or any DC/Marvel fans plsss ;-;
  
3. Let u know Im not into eddsoworld, COD, FNF, Dandy world, and some other fandom ;-;

My friends will force me to match with them  👍  👍 

4. I do also multi/crossover/rarepairs; I enjoy people yapping about their ships and AU. interesting or not. I still won't judge, and I'll respect it. Whatever it is AU, serious/silly ships, crossovers, headcanons, ect.


5. I make dry responses and feel awkward around new people, sometimes with other friends I'm not close to. It will take a while to 



6. If you mention Hal Jordan or Booster Gold, I will giggle and kick my feet. I'll yap bout them and include others like from DC, Transformers, Marvel, and Supernatural, etc ect. If you get tired of it, just let me know, plssss.

7. Sometimes I make jokes and say words out of blue, if that makes you extremely uncomfortable, please let me know.  😞
