                                           Hello! My name is Aster, and I also go by other names, like Mou, Archer, Naomi, Harold/Hal + more. I'm fine with people calling me by any nicknames as long as it's not inappropriate. I have no idea how to introduce myself, but I'll try my best! My favorite colors are orange, blue, purple, and green. I am an artist and I love to draw a lot. I sometimes post my artworks on social media. My English is not really that great; I make some spelling mistakes, and my words often come off. Sorry if I confuse you. I'm kinda awkward around everyone I don't know, so it would take me a while to interact/be more comfortable with them. 🫠 Please be patient with me. My friends are very awesome. I lied, be warned, they stinks. I don't play Ponytown as much anymore. I only joined with close friends. I'm fine with INT and C+H.

          ***[ INFO; ]***

 

         - INT/C*H is allowed even if I don't have it in my name. everyone is welcome.                           


    - Spanish is my mother tongue, and I was born in Puerto Rico


          - IDC about inspire. You do you 🫡

   ***Q - Where can you find me? ;***

      Well I usually stay in safe most of the time. You will found me sitting on marvel/dc(If you don't know where it is at, outside near the bakery; this area keep changing fandoms every months.) or Transformers, Deltarune/Undertale, ooor middle of nowhere. I stayed there to hang out with one of my closest buddies and chill. Most of time I am alone, I sometimes walk around the map or stay on an island when I'm bored, or do some random roleplay or something? No clue? okay . On 18+, I will mostly hangout in comic area with friends.
