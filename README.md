____________________________________

Hello! My name is Aster, and I also go by other names, like Mou, Archer, Naomi, Harold/Hal. I'm fine with people calling me by any nicknames as long as it's not inappropriate. I have no idea how to introduce myself, but I'll try my best! My favorite colors are orange, blue, purple, and green. I am an artist and I love to draw a lot. I sometimes post my artworks on social media. My English is not really that great; I make some spelling mistakes, and my words often come off. Sorry if I confuse you. I'm kinda awkward around everyone I don't know, so it would take me a while to interact/be more comfortable with them. 🫠 Please be patient with me. My friends are very awesome. I lied, be warned, they stinks. I don't play Ponytown as much anymore. I only joined with friends I’m comfortable wi. I'm fine with INT and C+H.

[ Extra; ]

I have ADHD/Autism spectrum /. And dyslexia. I have trouble with reading and other things, especially in my main language. I’m also struggling with social anxiety and socialization cues(I don't know if I'm spelling right), so I'll do the best I can. If I have upset you, made u uncomfortable, or anything like that, people do this often without telling me I did, and use it against me. Please please let me know I’m trying and I wanted to know what I did is wrong.😕 I may become clingy with the people I love, so please let me know if you ever feel uncomfortable with it.👍.

Spanish is my mother tongue, and I was born in Puerto Rico

Don’t ship me or characters I’m cosplaying. I’m not interested with anyone who only INT to shipped with my ponies unless you’re OOMF burrps👍

INTJ

I stay in safe most of the time. You will found me sitting on Deltarune/Undertale or middle of nowhere. I stayed there to hang out with one of my closest buddies and chill. I sometimes walk around the map or stay on an island when I'm bored, or do some random roleplay or something? No clue? okay

[ BYI; ]

♡ - DOUBLES; thinks Doubles? hmm.. I don't really mind. I sometimes won’t interact with doubles of my ID/highest kins, I mean, depending on how I feel, unless we’re already friends. I carelessly about doubles, saying "ooh that's me". I do take my kintye seriously,;-; I thought it would be nice to believe that double lives in a different universe or something like that.

Idk why I’m mentioning this but don’t ask me about my personal information and anything else, such as deadname or any my personal. There multiple people keep asking.,;-; I'm NOT giving out my personal stuff to strangers, especially someone I've known for 9 days or less 7 months. I prefer to keep it private unless you are a trusted friend. Like, I get you trying to know me better, but it's just weird and uncomfortable when strangers ask me these types of questions. I'm fine with someone asking me where I'm from or some stuff like that. I’m also okay with people asking my actual age but asking me my deadname is weird.

☆ - People especially friends and ex friends who break their own DNI/boundaries just to harass a random player they don’t like. I don't care what your excuse is, I don't want to hear you're gonna harass/bully and death-threaten them. Keep it to yourself you’re hella weird. And people who disrespect others' boundaries. Joke or not. you’re not funny

☆ Dramas. You can talk about it, but please don't drag me into one. fy; If you have issues with me or my friends, talk to us instead of trying to cause a huge problem or block us. Simple as that. I’m tired of dealing with these types of people🥹

Extra;

Dark/proshippers and antis are on thin ice. Ship wars sucks

Dni list are basic ig
