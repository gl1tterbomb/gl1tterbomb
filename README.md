Anyway, here are some things if you'd like to know about me. scroll down.

****ABOUT ME****;

Hello everypony! My name is Mou and I also go by other names, like Archer, Naomi, Harold/Hal, and more... I'm fine with people calling me by any silly nicknames ^^ as long as it's not inappropriate. I have no idea how to introduce myself, but I'll try my best! uhhhh, my favorite colors are orange, blue, purple, and green...I am an artist and I love to draw a lot. I sometimes post my artworks on social media. My English is not really that great; I make some grammatical mistakes, and my words often come off. Sorry if I confuse you. I'm kinda awkward around everypony I don't know, so it would take me a while to interact with them. ü´† Please be patient with me. My friends are very awesome. I lied, be warned they‚Äôre stinky ^_*



****[ EXTRA HMM?; ]****

-Pronouns? I use any! He/him and They/them is okay^^

- Spanish is my mother tongue, and I was born in Puerto Rico

- I have ADHD/Autism spectrum. Also, dyslexia. I have trouble with reading and other things, especially in my main language. #Woke #Genzthesedayssmhüòí

- INTJ

- ‚òÖ I‚Äôm fine with ships. Oc/canon or rarepair. As long its not pietro/magneto, wally/barry or hal/kyleüëçüëç. I'm fine with that.

I stay in safe most of the time. You will see me sitting in the Comic, Deltarune/Undertale, or Transformers area. I stayed there to hangout with one of my closest buddies and chill. Feel free to C+H! ^^ I sometimes walk around the map or stay on an island when I'm bored or do some random roleplay or something? No clue? okay
