____________________________________

Hello! My name is Aster, and I also go by other names, like Mou, Archer, Naomi, Harold/Hal. I'm fine with people calling me by any nicknames as long as it's not inappropriate. I have no idea how to introduce myself, but I'll try my best! My favorite colors are orange, blue, purple, and green. I am an artist and I love to draw a lot. I sometimes post my artworks on social media. My English is not really that great; I make some spelling mistakes, and my words often come off. Sorry if I confuse you. I'm kinda awkward around everyone I don't know, so it would take me a while to interact/be more comfortable with them. 🫠 Please be patient with me. My friends are very awesome. I lied, be warned, they stinks. I don't play Ponytown as much anymore. I only joined with close friends. I'm fine with INT and C+H.

[ Extra; ]

I have ADHD/Autism spectrum /. And dyslexia. I have trouble with reading, writing, and other things, especially in my main language. I have like a horror grammar. I’m also struggling with social anxiety and socialization cues(I don't know if I'm spelling right), so I'll do the best I can. If I have upset you, made u uncomfortable, or anything like that, people do this often without telling me I did, and use it against me. Please please let me know I’m trying and I wanted to know what I did is wrong.😕 I may become clingy with the people I love, so please let me know if you ever feel uncomfortable with it.👍.

Spanish is my mother tongue, and I was born in Puerto Rico



INTJ

Q - Where can you find me? ;

Well I usually stay in safe most of the time. You will found me sitting on marvel/dc(If you don't know where it is at, outside near the bakery; this area keep changing fandoms every months.) or Transformers, Deltarune/Undertale, ooor middle of nowhere. I stayed there to hang out with one of my closest buddies and chill. I sometimes walk around the map or stay on an island when I'm bored, or do some random roleplay or something? No clue? okay . On 18+, I will mostly hangout in comic area with friends.

random stuff with friends. I remake it 👍 [randomscreenshots](https://randomscreenshots.straw.page)

[ BYI; ]

♡ - DOUBLES; thinks Doubles? hmm.. I don't really mind. I sometimes won’t interact with doubles of my ID/highest kins, I mean, depending on how I feel, unless we’re already friends. I carelessly about doubles, saying "ooh that's me". I do take my kintye seriously,;-; I thought it would be nice to believe that double lives in a different universe or something like that.  [ I'm aware that I don't own any of the characters; if you have a problem with me not liking doubles, idk just don't int? ]
 


☆ Dramas. You can talk about it, but please don't drag me into one unless its serious ig. fy; If you have issues with me or my friends, talk to us instead of trying to cause a huge problem or block us. Simple as that. I’m tired of dealing with these types of people🥹
