Some info about me;
Hihihih! I'm Mou or Archer. I have no idea how to introduce myself, but I'll try my best. I'm an introvert; I don't talk much, and my English is very horrible, so my words often come off. I'm kinda awkward and have social anxiety, so it would take me a while to interact with people. 🫠 Please be patient with me. I'm an artist. I sometimes post my artworks on social media. I love Green Lanterns and alien robots. My friends are very cool. Birthday is on the 23rd November ^_*

Before you INT;

I have ADHD/Autism Lvl 3. No, I never watch these ¨DO I have autism¨ or search it up on the internet, so don't come after me, try fake claim that I don't have it. yes, fakers may sucks. 


. Please respect my boundaries. I am an insensitve person so please be careful with what you say, like sarcastic/NSFW/any comments. I often struggle to tell if you are being serious or not. If you are not a friend of ours, please do not throw "key"/any self-harms or insults. I get triggered easily, and it hurts, and I would think you are being serious about it

 
2. I block freely if I find out that any of y'all have alternate accounts just to stalk or harass. (You know who I'm talking to. *looking at you, @ccherrypie*).

3. No DNI needed.. 👍
   heh I lied, if you're @ccherrypie or you're friends with him. DNI. grrrrrr 🐺🐺
   (I need more booster gold fans or any dc fans plsss)
