****SOME INFO ABOUT****;

Hello everypony! My name is Mou and I also go by other names, like Dino, Naomi, Archer, Roddy, Harold/Hal, and more... I'm fine with people calling me by kin and any silly nicknames ^^ as long as it's not inappropriate. I have no idea how to introduce myself, but I'll try my best! uhhhh, my favorite color is orange and green...I am an artist and I love to draw a lot. I sometimes post my artworks on social media. I don't really talk that much, and my English is not that great; I make some mistakes, and my words often come off. Sorry if I confuse you. I'm kinda awkward around everypony I don't know, so it would take me a while to interact with them. 🫠 Please be patient with me. My friends are very awesome. I lied, be warned they’re stinky ^_*



****[ EXTRA HMM?; ]****

-Pronouns? I use any! He/him and They/them is okay^^

- Spanish is my mother tongue, and I was born in Puerto Rico

- I have ADHD/Autism spectrum and dyslexia. Anxiety n some crap.

- INTJ

I stay in safe most of the time. You will see me sitting in Comic area or Transformers hangi out with my friends, or whebn I'm bored, ooorr make some new friends.^^. I also go to the Deltarune/Undertale area with my friend. I stayed there to make ponies or RP. Sometimes I walk around the map or stay in island to make something?

****INT TIME**** !;


★. I rarely int and C+H with ponies first. I’m not good at starting or holding conversations. somtime I also make dry responses and feel awkward around new ponies, some with other friends I'm not close to. So I will try my best👍👍

★. - thinks Doubles? hmm.. I don’t really mind. I love to meet doubles ^

★- I do also multi/crossover/rarepairs; I enjoy people yapping about their ships and AU. interesting or not. I still won't judge, and I'll respect it. Whatever it is AU, serious/silly ships, crossovers, headcanons, etc. I FW OC/canon and selfshippers :D 

Here are my favorite ships. If u don't like them, then that's fine! [Strawpage 3](https://ang3lcake.straw.page/hobbies)

★ - I like to yap bout my interests. If you get tired of it, please let me know👍. I like green lantern and flash

★ I’m fine with ships. Oc/canon or rarepair. Just don’t make it weird ig?

If I haven’t responded to any of your messages, I’m sorry. I’m not trying to ignore you. There’s a chance I’m AFK, busy creating new ponies, or just slow to respond., and it’ll takes me a while, who knows. Feel free to whisper, and I'll check and reply! So uh please whisper 👍!

★ - pleaase I need more Booster Gold fans or any cool DC/Marvel friends plsss ;-;
